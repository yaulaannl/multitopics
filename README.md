## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

This is the wordpress theme from my site modernblackhand.com . I use this theme together with my "creating multi-topic wordpress site" tutorials. You can find the tutorials on my site.   

You can also welcome to use this theme as a base for your own theme creation. 



## Installation

1. Step 1 : Download the zip file and upload to your server, under [wordpress folder]/wp-content/themes . Try not to use wordpress' theme upload in the admin panel, as the file size might exceed wordpress' allowed upload file size. 
2. Step 2 : Unzip the file.
3. Step 3 : Go to wordpress admin panel. You should see the "multitopics" theme available. Install and activate it. 
4. Step 4 : Start modifying it to suit your need. You can learn how to do so via my website modernblackhand.com
